- Display campus-wide options for meals that are
  - High Protein
  - High Carb
  - Vegetarian/Vegan
 
- Filter out superfluous information

Stores data for N amount of time ahead, so that app experience is quicker


## MVP Info: 
Webapp that allows the user to select a dining option (ie high protein) and see 3 high-protein dining hall options around campus for the current dining time.

User: Health-Conscious Northwestern Students
Administrator: 1 NU student or NU employee
Competing Application: DineOnCampus

Application can:
- filter based on dietary preferences/macronutrient content

Current solutions: Use DineOnCampus and search through macronutrients yourself. (Slow, inefficient)
